                <p><strong>Terms and Conditions for No Registration Electric Vehicle Protection Plan</strong></p>
                <p>These terms and conditions ("Agreement") govern the No Registration Electric Vehicle Protection Plan
                    ("Plan") provided by MOBI PROTECT PVT LTD to the registered owner ("Owner") of an electric vehicle
                    ("EV"). By enrolling in the Plan, the Owner agrees to be bound by these terms and conditions.</p>

                <p><strong>What is covered under No Registration Electric Vehicle Protection Plan?</strong></p>
                <p>No Registration Electric Vehicle Protection Plan comes with a set of coverage that the company will
                    pay for on behalf of you. They are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Plan covers eligible electric vehicles that are not registered.</li>
                    <li>The Plan provides protection against mechanical breakdowns and failures that occur during the
                        term of the Plan, subject to the limitations and exclusions specified in this Agreement.</li>
                    <li>The coverage period begins on the date of enrollment and continues for the duration specified in
                        the Plan.</li>
                    <li>If you meet a road accident then the e-bike protection plan will provide you financial aid for
                        the loss or damage caused to the bike.</li>
                    <li>The company will provide cover for the expense that occurred in the replacement or repairing of
                        the damaged part of the e-bike.</li>
                    <li>If your e-bike gets stolen then this protection plan will provide you cover for it. Only if you
                        bought theft protection with the plan.</li>
                    <li>Damage caused to the bike during a natural calamity such as earthquakes, typhoons, flood, etc.
                        the company will provide cover for the damage caused.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>What is not covered under No Registration Electric Vehicle Protection Plan?</strong></p>
                <p>As you would know the coverage provided by your e-bike insurance, it is equally important to know the
                    things your protection plan does not cover. They are as follow:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Own Damage To Third-party Insurance Holder: If you only own a third-party liability insurance
                        plan and do not have a comprehensive protection plan then the company will not provide cover for
                        your own damages caused.</li>
                    <li>Drink &amp; Drive: If you are driving the e-bike under the influence of alcohol or drugs and
                        meet an accident, then the company finds out about it then no coverage will be provided by the
                        company.</li>
                    <li>Consequential Damage: Damage or loss caused to the bike that hasn’t directly happened in a road
                        accident or natural calamity, the company will not provide cover for it. For instance, your bike
                        gets damaged in an accident and you are not aware of damage caused to the bike’s batteries and
                        if you use it improperly that severely damages the battery or the body then the company will not
                        provide cover for it.</li>
                    <li>Intentional Negligence: If your e-bike has been damaged and you intentionally neglect the damage
                        and keep on riding on it that leads to bigger damage or you take your e-bike out during a
                        natural calamity as mentioned in the manufacturer’s driving manual then the company will not
                        provide cover for it.</li>
                    <li>Lapse Protection Plan: In case you do not renew your e-bike protection plan then the protection
                        plan will not provide the cover for loss or damage caused to the bike after the lapse of the
                        policy.</li>
                </ul>
